## About

An open sourced, URL Shortener Portal that makes use of firebase to store links mapped to suffixes. Newly made with a GUI for SST Inc EXCO to add links. Made with :heart: by [Ryan The](https://ryanthe.com/) @theboi using Next.js, React and TypeScript. Version 1.0 using Firebase Dynamic Links by Jia Chen.

## How It Works

- For SST Inc EXCO/BOD only.
- Go to [go.sstinc.org](https://go.sstinc.org) or (Beta June 2020: [go-sstinc-org.now.sh](https://go-sstinc-org.now.sh)).
- Sign in with Google using your SST Google Account.
- Create a new shortened link, filling in a Title, Long Link, and New Link.
- Share the new shortened link.

## Installation (for development by SST Inc members)

- Clone (or download) the project from GitHub.
- In the terminal, navigate to the project directory and run (you will need npm):
```shell
npm i
```
- Contact me to give you access to the Firebase project (you will need to be a member of SST Inc. to do this, obviously).
